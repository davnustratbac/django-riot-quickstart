# Django + Riot Quick Start
##About

The primary purpose of this project is to create a base that I can work from on personal projects where much of the setup is already completed. It may also serve as inspiration for other developers to work from. Understand that it may be subject to major changes with no warning. **USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.**

The project assumes that the following are already installed:

1. Python 3
2. Pip3
3. Node Package Manager

It is recommended that a Virtual Environment is created for your python project, using either VirtualEnv or Pyvenv.

Following the installation instructions will set you up with a new Python3 Django project, using a MySQL database, Riot for custom elements, Browserify for module management, Karma/Jasmine for  js unit testing and Gulp for task management. The Gulp file is set up to generate unique js and css files for each page on your website. Alternatively you may create a master js and css file for your entire webpage, if you wish.
